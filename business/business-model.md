# MobilityCorp Business Model

This document outlines MobilityCorp’s business model and explains how MobilityCorp operates and how it generates revenue.

The following is taken from the Introduction slides, which can be found under: [MobilityCorp Introduction Slides (PDF)](https://on24static.akamaized.net/event/50/61/50/5/rt/1/documents/resourceList1760443315324/q4architecturekatamobilitycorp1760443315324.pdf)




## Overview
MobilityCorp provides **short-term, location-based rentals** for a fully electric fleet of scooters, eBikes, cars, and vans.  
Customers use a **mobile app** (and occasionally a web portal) to locate a vehicle, book it, unlock it, ride or drive it, and return it to a designated bay.

The service is designed for **convenient, fast last-mile transport** in dense urban areas, but the car and van fleet is also increasingly used in suburban regions for errands, deliveries, and short trips.

All vehicles are **GPS-enabled** and can be **remotely unlocked and monitored**, which allows MobilityCorp to manage fleet availability, track returns, automate billing, and support operational workflows like battery swapping and relocation.

The company’s business model relies on **high fleet utilization**, **low friction for customers**, and **cost-efficient operations**—especially around rebalancing and keeping vehicles charged.


## How the Rental Model Works

### Bookings
- **Cars and Vans**  
  Customers can book these vehicles **up to 7 days in advance** for a fixed duration.
- **Scooters and eBikes**  
  Bookings can be made **up to 30 minutes in advance**, and rentals are open-ended (up to 12 hours).


### Payments
Customers pay **per minute** of active rental time.  
Additional charges apply for:
- Returning vehicles late  
- Parking in the wrong location  
- Not plugging in cars/vans when required  

This model encourages responsible returns and helps keep the fleet usable for the next customer.

### Vehicle Return
All vehicles must be returned to a **designated parking spot**.  
To confirm the return:
- Users must submit **photos** of the parked vehicle.
- Cars and vans must be **plugged into the EV charger** at their assigned bay.
- Customers provide **feedback**, including possible faults or issues.

This simple flow allows MobilityCorp to maintain quality and quickly identify vehicles needing service.

## Operations and Fleet Management

### Battery Swapping and Charging
Scooters and eBikes use removable battery packs.  
Company staff travel between bays in vans to:
- Swap empty batteries for charged ones  
- Keep scooters and bikes ready for use  
- Move them to higher-demand areas when needed  

Cars and vans rely on fixed charging stations, and customers are expected to plug them in on return.

### Vehicle Redistribution
A key part of the business is making sure vehicles are available where people actually need them.  
Staff relocate scooters and bikes between bays to keep supply aligned with demand throughout the day.  
This is also where the company faces one of its biggest challenges.


## Revenue Model
MobilityCorp earns revenue through:
- **Per-minute rental fees** across all vehicle types
- **Late return and incorrect parking fines**
- **Advance bookings** (primarily for cars and vans)
- **Incentives-based usage**  
  Discounts or rewards encourage riders to return vehicles to strategic locations, reducing operational costs.

This simple, usage-based model works well in cities where short trips and spontaneous rentals dominate.


## Growth and Scalability XXX TODO
Today, the fleet is **fixed per country**, but MobilityCorp expects to expand as demand grows.  
Before scaling, the primary goal is to **maximize utilization of existing vehicles**, which requires:
- Better demand forecasting  
- Smarter relocation  
- Efficient battery management  
- Reducing downtime due to poor fleet placement  

These goals strongly influence the system architecture and motivate the AI components described later.


## Summary
MobilityCorp operates a straightforward but operationally complex mobility service built on:
- An electric fleet  
- A mobile-first customer experience  
- Short-term rentals with flexible booking rules  

The challenges around demand forecasting, vehicle placement, and battery swapping are central to the business model and are directly addressed by the AI-driven architectural solution described in later sections.
