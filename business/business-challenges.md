# Business Challenges for MobilityCorp


## 1. Demand-Supply Mismatch


**Problem:**  
> “Customers complain that the right vehicles aren’t in the right places!”


### Challenges

- Unpredictable demand peaks.
- Idle vehicles at low-traffic bays.
- Overcrowding or understocking during rush hours or events.


### Key Questions

- How do we **anticipate when and where** vehicles are needed?
- Can we **pre-position** vehicles in advance of demand?


### Potential Solutions

- ✅ **AI-Powered Demand Forecasting**:
  - Use historical usage data, time of day, day of week, location, and weather to train predictive models.
  - Use clustering to identify demand hotspots.
- ✅ **Dynamic Rebalancing Algorithms**:
  - Schedule field staff to relocate bikes/scooters proactively.
  - Use reinforcement learning to optimize rebalancing over time.
- ✅ **Geospatial Analytics Dashboards**:
  - Visualize real-time vs predicted demand to aid operations planning.


## 2. Battery Drainage and Charging Inefficiency

**Problem:**  
> “Electric vehicles are running out of charge before they can be serviced.”


### Challenges

- Limited staff for battery swaps.
- Charging cycles not optimized.
- No prioritization system.


### Key Questions

- Which vehicles are **most at risk** of running out soon?
- Which **locations** have the **highest priority** for servicing?


### Potential Solutions

- ✅ **Battery Health Monitoring System**:
  - Collect live telemetry from IoT modules in each vehicle.
  - Predict remaining useful battery life.
- ✅ **Prioritized Servicing Schedule**:
  - Score each parking bay based on:
    - Vehicle usage rates.
    - Number of low-battery units.
    - Upcoming predicted demand.
- ✅ **AI Optimization for Field Routes**:
  - Use vehicle and battery priority scores to optimize staff routing (e.g., via Traveling Salesman Problem solver).


## 3. Low Customer Retention and Frequency

**Problem:**  
> “Most customers use us on an ad-hoc basis – we want them to rely on us for regular commutes.”


### Challenges

- Limited recurring users.
- Low app stickiness.
- Price sensitivity for habitual use.


### Key Questions

- How can we encourage **habitual use**?
- Can we identify and **incentivize** commuters?


### Potential Solutions

- ✅ **Customer Segmentation**:
  - Analyze usage patterns to identify potential daily commuters.
- ✅ **Personalized Promotions**:
  - Use ML models to predict next ride time and push targeted offers (e.g., "Your 8:15 AM ride is waiting – 10% off today!")
- ✅ **Subscription / Commuter Plans**:
  - Offer discounted passes for frequent users (e.g., unlimited rides during morning/evening commute windows).
- ✅ **Gamification**:
  - Points, badges, or rewards for daily streaks, eco-mile milestones, etc.
