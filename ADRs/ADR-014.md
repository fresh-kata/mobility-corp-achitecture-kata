# MCP Protocol Standardization

**Short Description:**  
Use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate external tools and data.

**Status:** Accepted

### Context
The system requires multiple data providers (maps, weather, events, transit) which may change over time.

### Decision
Standardize all integrations through MCP for easy provider replacement.

### Consequences
- Reduces vendor lock-in
- Adds development effort for adapters

### Compliance
Enforce JSON schema contracts and continuous integration tests for all MCP interfaces.
