# CONTEXT

The mobile application needs to communicate seamlessly with vehicles to enable features such as remote control, diagnostics, and updates. The decision is driven by the need for a reliable, secure, and scalable communication interface.

# DECISION

In the context of enabling communication between the mobile app and vehicles, facing concerns about security, scalability, and performance, we decided for a RESTful API over HTTPS and neglected alternatives like MQTT or WebSockets, to achieve ease of implementation, compatibility with existing systems, and secure data transmission, accepting potential latency issues and lack of real-time capabilities, because RESTful APIs are widely supported and easier to maintain.

# CONSEQUENCES

The decision ensures secure and scalable communication but may introduce latency and limit real-time interactions. Future enhancements may require revisiting this decision if real-time capabilities become critical.

# COMPLIANCE

Compliance will be ensured by implementing API design guidelines, conducting regular security audits, and monitoring performance metrics.
