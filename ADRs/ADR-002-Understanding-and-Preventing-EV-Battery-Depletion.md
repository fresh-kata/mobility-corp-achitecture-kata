This ADR documents the decision to implement monitoring and preventive measures to reduce the risk of electric vehicle (EV) battery depletion in the field.

# CONTEXT

As EV adoption increases, unexpected battery depletion has become a significant concern for both users and fleet operators. Key drivers include user experience, operational reliability, and the need to minimize roadside assistance incidents. Factors such as inaccurate range estimation, lack of charging infrastructure, and user behavior contribute to the risk of battery depletion.

# DECISION

We decided to implement a multi-layered approach combining real-time battery monitoring, predictive analytics for range estimation, and proactive user notifications. Alternative options considered included relying solely on user education or only improving range estimation algorithms. Our chosen approach aims to maximize system reliability and user satisfaction by providing timely warnings and actionable insights, accepting the increased complexity and development effort required to integrate these features.

# CONSEQUENCES

This decision will improve user confidence and reduce the frequency of battery depletion incidents, but it introduces additional system complexity and requires ongoing maintenance of analytics models. There may be increased costs associated with data collection and processing.

# COMPLIANCE

Compliance will be ensured through automated testing of monitoring and notification features, regular audits of analytics accuracy, and user feedback mechanisms to identify gaps or failures in the system.
