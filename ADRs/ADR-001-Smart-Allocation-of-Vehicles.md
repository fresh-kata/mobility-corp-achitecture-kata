# Smart Allocation of Vehicles

Short description of the architecture decision

Author: Bahram Jahanshahi  
Status: PROPOSED  
Type: PROCESS  
Created: 2024-06-15  
Post-history:  

# CONTEXT

Our customers keep complaining that the right vehicles arenâ€™t in the right places!  
- How do we know when people will want to use the vehicles?  
- Can we anticipate customer needs?  

# DECISION

In the context of improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, facing the challenge of vehicle misallocation, we decided to explore smart allocation strategies and neglected manual allocation methods, to achieve better resource utilization and customer experience, accepting the complexity of implementing predictive algorithms, because it aligns with our long-term goals of scalability and automation.

# CONSEQUENCES

The impact of this decision includes:  
- Improved customer satisfaction due to better vehicle availability.  
- Increased operational complexity and potential higher initial costs.  
- Dependency on accurate data and predictive models.  

# COMPLIANCE

To ensure compliance with this decision:  
- Regularly review and refine predictive algorithms.  
- Monitor customer feedback and adjust allocation strategies accordingly.  
- Conduct periodic audits of the system's performance.  

# COMMENTS

Further research is needed on predictive modeling techniques and data collection methods.
