# Phased Autonomy Levels

**Short Description:**  
Introduce automation gradually: advisory (L0), assisted booking (L1), and auto-booking (L2).

**Status:** Accepted

### Context
Immediate full automation might lead to user mistrust and legal issues.

### Decision
Start with human-supervised levels before moving to full autonomy.

### Consequences
- Builds user confidence
- Slower automation rollout

### Compliance
Enforce policy gating and user consent before increasing autonomy levels.
