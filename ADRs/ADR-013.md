# Architecture Type — Agentic AI over Static Rules

**Short Description:**  
Use an agent-based approach instead of static or rule-based trip planning.

**Status:** Accepted

### Context
The environment (traffic, events, weather, charging status) changes frequently.  
A rule-based system cannot adapt to uncertainty or re-plan dynamically.

### Decision
Implement an AI agent that reasons, plans, and acts using real-time data from MCP tools.

### Consequences
- Improved flexibility and personalization
- Higher system complexity and need for monitoring

### Compliance
Regular monitoring of the agent’s decision outcomes, fallback mechanisms for manual override, and logging of every decision for auditing.
